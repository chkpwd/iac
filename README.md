# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by Bryan J.

## General Overview

This repository provides a set of tools and configurations for automating tasks across environments, including Ansible playbooks and roles, Docker configurations, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, and Packer scripts, with secrets managed through SOPs integration. I tried not to be opinionated in the way I tackle issues.
