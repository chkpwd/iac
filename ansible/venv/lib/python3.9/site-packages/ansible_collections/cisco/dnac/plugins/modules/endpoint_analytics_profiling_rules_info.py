module: endpoint_analytics_profiling_rules_info
short_description: Information module for Endpoint Analytics Profiling Rules
description:
- Get all Endpoint Analytics Profiling Rules.
- Get Endpoint Analytics Profiling Rules by id.
- Fetches details of the profiling rule for the given 'ruleId'.
- This API fetches the list of profiling rules. It can be used to show profiling rules in client applications, or export those from an environment.
  'POST /profiling-rules/bulk' API can be used to import such exported rules into another environment.
  If this API is used to export rules to be imported into another Cisco DNA Center system, then ensure that 'includeDeleted' parameter is 'true',
  so that deleted rules get synchronized correctly.
  Use query parameters to filter the data, as required. If no filter is provided, then it will include only rules of type 'Custom Rule' in the response.
  By default, the response is limited to 500 records. Use 'limit' parameter to fetch higher number of records, if required.
  'GET /profiling-rules/count' API can be used to find out the total number of rules in the system.
version_added: '4.0.0'
