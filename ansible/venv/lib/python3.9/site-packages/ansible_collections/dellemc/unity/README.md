# Ansible Modules for Dell Technologies Unity

The Ansible Modules for Dell Technologies (Dell) Unity allow Data Center and IT administrators to use RedHat Ansible to automate and orchestrate the configuration and management of Dell Unity arrays.

The capabilities of the Ansible modules are managing consistency groups, filesystem, filesystem snapshots, CIFS server, NAS server, NFS server, NFS export, SMB share, interface, hosts, snapshots, snapshot schedules, storage pools, user quotas, quota trees and volumes. Capabilities also include gathering facts from the array. The options available for each are list, show, create, modify and delete. These tasks can be executed by running simple playbooks written in yaml syntax. The modules are written so that all the operations are idempotent, so making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request.

## Prerequisites
This table provides information about the software prerequisites for the Ansible Modules for Dell Unity.

| **Ansible Modules** | **Python version** | **Storops - Python SDK version** | **Ansible** |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|

## Idempotency
The modules are written in such a way that all requests are idempotent and hence fault-tolerant. It essentially means that the result of a successfully performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed.
