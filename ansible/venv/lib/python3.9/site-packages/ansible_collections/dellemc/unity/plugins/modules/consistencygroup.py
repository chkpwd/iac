short_description: Manage consistency groups on Unity storage system
description:
- Managing the consistency group on the Unity storage system includes
  creating new consistency group, adding volumes to consistency
  group, removing volumes from consistency group, mapping hosts to
  consistency group, unmapping hosts from consistency group,
  renaming consistency group, modifying attributes of consistency group,
  enabling replication in consistency group, disabling replication in
  consistency group and deleting consistency group.
