module: fmgr_wanprof_system_sdwan
short_description: Configure redundant internet connections using SD-WAN
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiManager device.
    - Examples include all parameters and values which need to be adjusted to data sources before usage.

notes:
    - Running in workspace locking mode is supported in this FortiManager module, the top
      level parameters workspace_locking_adom and workspace_locking_timeout help do the work.
    - To create or update an object, use state present directive.
    - To delete an object, use state absent directive.
    - Normally, running one module can fail when a non-zero rc is returned. you can also override
      the conditions to fail or succeed with parameters rc_failed and rc_succeeded
