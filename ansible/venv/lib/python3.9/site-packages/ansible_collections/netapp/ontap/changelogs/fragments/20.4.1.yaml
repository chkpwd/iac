minor_changes:
  - na_ontap_firmware_upgrade - ``force_disruptive_update`` and ``package_url`` options allows to make choices for download and upgrading packages.
  - na_ontap_autosupport_invoke - added REST support for sending autosupport message.
  - na_ontap_vserver_create has a new default variable ``netapp_version`` set to 140.  
    If you are running 9.2 or below please add the variable to your playbook and set to 120

bugfixes:
  - na_ontap_volume - ``volume_security_style`` option now allows modify.
  - na_ontap_info - ``metrocluster_check_info`` has been removed as it was breaking the info module for everyone who didn't have a metrocluster set up. 
    We are working on adding this back in a future update.
