minor_changes:
  - na_ontap_rest_info - The Default for ``gather_subset`` has been changed to demo which returns ``cluster/software``, ``svm/svms``, ``cluster/nodes``. To return all Info must specificly list ``all`` in your playbook. Do note ``all`` is a very resource-intensive action and it is highly recommended to call just the info/APIs you need.
  - na_ontap_rest_info - All Info that exist in ``na_ontap_info`` that has REST equivalents have been implemented. Note that the returned structure for REST and the variable names in the structure is different from the ZAPI based ``na_ontap_info``. Some default variables in ZAPI are no longer returned by default in REST and will need to be specified using the ``field`` option.
  - na_ontap_rest_info - The following info subsets have been added ``system_node_info``, ``net_interface_info``, ``net_port_info``, ``security_login_account_info``, ``vserver_peer_info``, ``cluster_image_info``, ``cluster_log_forwarding_info``, ``metrocluster_info``, ``metrocluster_node_info``, ``net_dns_info``, ``net_interface_service_policy_info``, ``vserver_nfs_info``, ``clock_info``, ``igroup_info``, ``vscan_status_info``, ``vscan_connection_status_all_info``, ``storage_bridge_info``, ``nvme_info``, ``nvme_interface_info``, ``nvme_subsystem_info``, ``cluster_switch_info``, ``export_policy_info``, ``kerberos_realm_info``,``sis_info``, ``sis_policy_info``, ``snapmirror_info``, ``snapmirror_destination_info``, ``snapmirror_policy_info``, ``sys_cluster_alerts``, ``cifs_vserver_security_info``
