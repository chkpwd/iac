bugfixes:
  - na_ontap_snapmirror - ``source_path`` and ``source_hostname`` parameters are not mandatory to delete snapmirror relationship when source cluster is unknown, if specified it will delete snapmirror at destination and release the same at source side.  if not, it only deletes the snapmirror at destination and will not look for source to perform snapmirror release.
