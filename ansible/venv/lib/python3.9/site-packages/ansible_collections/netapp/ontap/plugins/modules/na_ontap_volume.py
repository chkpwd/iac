  logical_space_enforcement:
    description:
      - This optionally specifies whether to perform logical space accounting on the volume. When space is enforced
        logically, ONTAP enforces volume settings such that all the physical space saved by the storage efficiency
        features will be calculated as used.
      - This is only supported with REST.
    type: bool
    version_added: '20.16.0'

  logical_space_reporting:
    description:
      - This optionally specifies whether to report space logically on the volume. When space is reported logically,
        ONTAP reports the volume space such that all the physical space saved by the storage efficiency features are also
        reported as used.
      - This is only supported with REST.
    type: bool
    version_added: '20.16.0'

  snaplock:
    description:
      - Starting with ONTAP 9.10.1, snaplock.type is set at the volume level.
      - The other suboptions can be set or modified when using REST on earlier versions of ONTAP.
      - This option and suboptions are only supported with REST.
    type: dict
    version_added: 21.18.0
    suboptions:
      append_mode_enabled:
        description:
          - when enabled, all the files created with write permissions on the volume are, by default,
            WORM appendable files. The user can append the data to a WORM appendable file but cannot modify
            the existing contents of the file nor delete the file until it expires.
        type: bool
      autocommit_period:
        description:
          - autocommit period for SnapLock volume. All files which are not modified for a period greater than
            the autocommit period of the volume are committed to the WORM state.
          - duration is in the ISO-8601 duration format (eg PY, PM, PD, PTH, PTM).
          - examples P30M, P10Y, PT1H, "none".  A duration that combines different periods is not supported.
        type: str
      privileged_delete:
        description:
          - privileged-delete attribute of a SnapLock volume.
          - On a SnapLock Enterprise (SLE) volume, a designated privileged user can selectively delete files irrespective of the retention time of the file.
          - On a SnapLock Compliance (SLC) volume, it is always permanently_disabled.
        type: str
        choices: [disabled, enabled, permanently_disabled]
      retention:
        description:
          - default, maximum, and minumum retention periods for files committed to the WORM state on the volume.
          - durations are in the ISO-8601 duration format, see autocommit_period.
        type: dict
        suboptions:
          default:
            description:
              - default retention period that is applied to files while committing them to the WORM state without an associated retention period.
            type: str
          maximum:
            description:
              - maximum allowed retention period for files committed to the WORM state on the volume.
            type: str
          minimum:
            description:
              - minimum allowed retention period for files committed to the WORM state on the volume.
            type: str
      type:
        description:
          - The SnapLock type of the volume.
          - compliance - A SnapLock Compliance (SLC) volume provides the highest level of WORM protection and
            an administrator cannot destroy a SLC volume if it contains unexpired WORM files.
          - enterprise - An administrator can delete a SnapLock Enterprise (SLE) volume.
          - non_snaplock - Indicates the volume is non-snaplock.
        type: str
        choices: [compliance, enterprise, non_snaplock]

  max_files:
    description:
      - The maximum number of files (inodes) for user-visible data allowed on the volume.
      - Note - ONTAP allocates a slightly different value, for instance 3990 when asking for 4000.
        Tp preserve idempotency, small variations in size are ignored.
    type: int
    version_added: '20.18.0'

  analytics:
    description:
      - Set file system analytics state of the volume.
      - Only supported with REST and requires ONTAP 9.8 or later version.
      - Cannot enable analytics for volume that contains luns.
    type: str
    version_added: '22.0.0'
    choices: ['on', 'off']

notes:
  - supports REST and ZAPI.  REST requires ONTAP 9.6 or later.  Efficiency with REST requires ONTAP 9.7 or later.
  - REST is enabled when C(use_rest) is set to always.
  - The feature_flag C(warn_or_fail_on_fabricpool_backend_change) controls whether an error is reported when
    tiering control would require or disallow FabricPool for an existing volume with a different backend.
    Allowed values are fail, warn, and ignore, and the default is set to fail.
  - snapshot_restore is not idempotent, it always restores.
