NetApp E-Series SANtricity Collection
=========
    The SANtricity collection consist of the latest available versions of the NetApp E-Series SANtricity modules and roles.

        This collection provides NetApp E-Series customers with a wide range of configuration options through the collection's modules. However, the real
    benefit of using the SANtricity collection is found in the host and management roles. These roles provide ready-made, policy-based orchestration for
    E-Series platforms based on predefined role variables.
        Once the physical hardware has been installed, the SANtricity roles are capable of discovering the DHCP-assigned addresses, setting initial passwords
    and management interfaces so your automation can do full deployments for you without logging directly into the devices. Yet that's just the beginning,
    the management role will also ensure alerts, ASUP, logging, LDAP, and firmware are configured as expected; and the host role will setup host interfaces,
    provision and map storage, and if your servers are defined in the inventory, correctly populate E-Series hosts and host groups automatically.

Storage System Credentials
--------------------------
    Proxy:
        - The proxy's credentials should be defined at the group inventory level (eseries_proxy_api_url, eseries_proxy_api_password, eseries_subnet) and each storage system host inventory file should include its password (eseries_system_password) and the system's serial number (eseries_system_serial).
        - You can substitute a unique proxy storage system identifier (eseries_proxy_ssid) for the system's serial number if the system has already been added to the proxy. However, using the storage system serial number is the preferred method since it will never change and is always known to the system. If you would like to be able to reference the system from the proxy using a unique identifier of your choice then add it in addition to the system's serial number.
        - If your storage system has never been added to the Web Service Proxy, utilizing your system's serial number (eseries_system_serial) ensures that the SANtricity collection can discover it and set its initial admin password if not previously done.

    Direct:
        - Provide the storage system's serial number, password and the network subnet (eseries_system_serial, eseries_system_password, and eseries_subnet) to ensure that it will be discoverable; this information will also ensure the admin password has been set. The discovery process can be lengthy depending on the size and speed of the subnet. This can be mitigated by configuring static management interfaces (eseries_management_interfaces) otherwise each playbook execution will search for the DHCP assigned address.
        - If the storage system's Web Service Embedded API url (eseries_system_api_url) is known then it can be used in place of the system's serial number.

Snapshots
---------
    - Automate snapshot consistency groups with one or more base volumes. Consistency groups allow snapshot images to be taken consistently across multiple base volumes at a single point in time. Then use these images to either create snapshot volumes or rollback the base volumes to previous states. Snapshot volumes allow you to interact with the volumes as they were in either a read-only or read-write mode.
    - Since E-Series storage systems are block storage and are unaware of both file system and application, it important to prepare volumes for snapshots. This requires applications to complete anything necessary to place the data in a valid state and file systems to complete and sync data to storage. To help facilitate these actions, checkout the snapshot role in the netapp_eseries.host collection (https://galaxy.ansible.com/netapp_eseries/host). This snapshot role ensures mounted E-Series volumes across multiple hosts have files closed, synced cache, and are temporarily unmounted prior to taking snapshots. Want to take a point-in-time snapshot of a parallel file system? The snapshot role also ensures that volumes are also ready across multiple storage systems.

General Notes
-------------
    - The EF600/300 platforms currently do not distribute drives across their PCI bridges which can result in lower than expected performance when drives become saturated so be sure to use either eseries_storage_pool_usable_drives to specify the order the drives should be selected or the eseries_storage_pool_configuration usable_drives argument to specify which drives should be used. See details in the `Collection Variables` section. The example below will ensure the drive candidate selections for EF600/300 storage pools or volume groups are selected by alternating between the first and last twelve drives. You can also specify the tray drawers in the form <tray>:<drawer>:<slot>.
        `eseries_storage_pool_usable_drives: "99:0,99:23,99:1,99:22,99:2,99:21,99:3,99:20,99:4,99:19,99:5,99:18,99:6,99:17,99:7,99:16,99:8,99:15,99:9,99:14,99:10,99:13,99:11,99:12"`

Remove Inventory Configuration
------------------------------
Whether its for a testing automation or a temporary project, its helpful to be able to undo all that you configured. Just set `eseries_remove_all_configuration: True` and nar_santricity_host will remove all it configured. Be aware that this feature does not know the previous state of anything; it simply removes anything specified in the inventory.
