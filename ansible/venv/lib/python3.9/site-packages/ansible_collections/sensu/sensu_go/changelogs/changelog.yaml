        Bonsai asset definitions can be downloaded on controller or remote nodes 

        A user can decide if Bonsai asset definitions should be downloaded to
        remote nodes or the controller node. This is useful, but not limited to,

        Keeping up with the updates

        In this release, community contributed support for the OracleLinux. We
        added a few tests to catch if things break in the future and this is
        about it. And while we were at work, we also added support for Sensu Go

        Sensu Go 6.3.0 is here

        For this release, we only updated the list of available Sensu Go agent
        versions for Windows, and made sure collection works with the latest
        Sensu Go version.
      minor_changes:
        - Update list of available Sensu Go agent packages for Windows

      release_summary: |
        Validate all the things!

        If you ever thought to yourself, "Ansible does not yell enough at me,"
        we have some great news. The Sensu Go Ansible Collection gained role
        argument specifications, making it possible to validate variable values
        before executing a role. You are welcome ;)
      minor_changes:
        - Add argument specification to the install role.
        - Add argument specification to the backend role.
        - Add argument specification to the agent role.

    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Authentication, authentication on the wall, Who has Access to Them All?

        New modules allow Sensu Go users to configure authentication within
        their Ansible playbooks. The users can authenticate via external
        authentication providers such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP),
        Active Directory (AD), or OpenID Connect 1.0 protocol (OIDC).
      minor_changes:
        - Add modules for managing Sensu Go authentication providers.
    modules:
      - name: ad_auth_provider
        description: Manage Sensu AD authentication provider
        namespace: ""

  1.9.4:
    release_date: "2021-03-30"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Opening Windows for real

        This is a bugfix release that makes sure Sensu Go Ansible Collection
        can operate even in the absence of the Windows Ansible Collection
        (assuming we do not want to manage agents on Windows hosts, that is).
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure we lazy-load Windows-related content.

  1.9.3:
    release_date: "2021-03-30"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Opening Windows

        The only change in this release is removal of the ``ansible.windows``
        dependency. This should allow users that only use certified collections
        to install and use the collection.
      minor_hanges:
        - Remove Windows Ansible Collection dependency.

  1.9.2:
    release_date: "2021-03-28"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        A fresh batch of updates

        For this release, we only updated the list of available Sensu Go agent
        versions for Windows.
      minor_hanges:
        - Update list of available Sensu Go agent packages for Windows
          installations (added 5.21.4, 5.21.5, 6.2.5, and 6.2.6).
  1.9.1:
    release_date: "2021-03-08"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Containerize all the things

        There are two main reasons for this release. We made sure the Sensu Go
        Ansible Collection works with development version of Ansible (upcoming
        ansible-core 2.11). And we added enough metadata to the collection that
        ansible-builder can create an execution environment with the Sensu Go
        Ansible Collection without having to manually specify dependencies.
      bugfixes:
        - Add ansible.windows dependency that we forgot to add when we
          introducted the Sensu Go agent installation on Windows.

  1.9.0:
    release_date: "2021-02-28"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Multi-cluster visibility with federation

        Two new module pairs allow Sensu Go users to configure federation from
        the comfort of their Ansible playbooks.
      minor_changes:
        - Add modules for managing etcd replicatiors, which form the basis of
          the Sensu Go federation.
        - Add modules for managing Sensu Go clusters.
        - Update list of available Sensu Go agent packages for Windows
          installations.
      bugfixes:
        - Allow downgrading Sensu Go packages on Linux distributions that use
          yum or dnf for package management.
    modules:
      - name: cluster
        description: Manage Sensu Go clusters
        namespace: ""

    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Supporting hashed user passwords

        Starting with this release, Sensu Go users can use password hashes
        directly when manipulating role-based access control resources.
      minor_changes:
        - Add support for hashed password in user module.
      bugfixes:
        - Mimic actual responses when user module runs in check mode.
        - Make it possible to use modules on Sensu Go backends with no version
          number.

  1.7.2:
    release_date: "2021-01-21"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Be kind

        The main thing in this release is a small adjustment of our code of
        conduct that is a bit more generic and less event-focused.
      minor_changes:
        - Specify minimal python version for modules.
        - Update code of conduct.
        - List version 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 in Windows lookup table.

  1.7.1:
    release_date: "2020-12-30"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Slow and steady

        There are no major new features in this release, just honest little
        fixes that should make using Sensu Go Ansible Collection a bit more
        pleasant.
      minor_changes:
        - List version 6.2.0 and 6.1.3 in Windows lookup table.
        - Add module return value samples.

        Say hello to Amazon Linux and Windows

        As the title suggests, we worked hard to bring you two new supported
        platforms to the Sensu Go Ansible Colletions. And yes, all your
        existing playbooks still work.All you need to do is run them against
        the right host and voila ;)
      minor_changes:
        - Add support for installing Sensu Go on Amazon Linux.
        - Add support for installing Sensu Go agents on Windows.

    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Comparing entities is hard
        
        This is a bugfix release that makes sure agent entity changes are
        properly detected.
      bugfixes:
        - Make subscriptions comparison insensitive to ordering.
        - Make sure agent entities handle *entity:{name}* automatic
          subscriptions.

      release_summary: |
        Our little secret
        
        This release contains a few new modules that allow you to manage all
        things related to the Sensu Go secrets: from adding secrets providers
        to passing secrets to resources that know how to use them.
      minor_changes:
       - Add modules for managing Sensu Go secret providers.
       - Add modules for managing Sensu Go secrets.
       - Add support for secrets to pipe handler module.
       - Add support for secrets to check module.

  1.5.0:
    release_date: "2020-07-24"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Self-signed security
        
        The primary focus of this release is to enable configuration of Sensu
        Go backends that use certificates that are not considered trusted when
        using system-provided CA bundle.
      minor_changes:
        - Allow modules to supply custom CA bundle for backend certificate
          validation or skip the validation entirely.
      bugfixes:
        - Expand documentation about the *check_hooks* parameter in the check
          module.
        - Explain how the resource name parameter is used and what invariants
          need to hold in order for the Sensu Go to consider it a valid name.

  1.4.2:
    release_date: "2020-07-02"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Break the fall

        There is really only one reason for this release: making sure user
        management works with Sensu Go 5.21.0 and newer. And while the
        upstream did break the API, we did not, so all your playbooks should
        function as nothing happened. We had to add a *bcrypt* dependency to
        our collection so make sure it is installed on hosts that will execute
        the user module.
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure check module is as idempotent as possible.
        - Make user module compatible with Sensu Go >= 5.21.0.

  1.4.1:
    release_date: "2020-06-25"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Maintenance is the name of the game
        
        There are no nothing earth-shattering changes in this release, just
        honest little bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

        **NOTE:** The *sensu.sensu_go.user* module currently **DOES NOT** work
        on Sensu Go 5.21.0 and later. This is a know issue that will be fixed
        as soon as the updated user-related backend API endpoints are
        documented.
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure event module always returns a predicted result.
        - Make user module fully-idempotent. Previous versions did not
          properly detect the password changes.
        - Use fully-qualified collection names in module documentation.
        - Ensure backend initialization properly reports changed state.
        - Make API key authentication work even for regular users with limited
          permissions.
        - Update the datastore module to cope with the minor API changes.

  1.4.0:
    release_date: "2020-04-30"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Keeping up with the world
        
        Main changes in this release are related to updates in the Sensu Go's
        web API that broke our change detection.
      minor_changes:
        - Add support for RHEL and CentOS 8.
      bugfixes:
        - Fix resource metadata comparison on Sensu Go 5.19.0 and newer.
        - Update entity comparator to handle new fields.

        Bug fixing galore
        
        This release makes it possible to use the *asset* module when
        replacing the deprecated, single-build assets that were created by
        means other than Ansible.
      bugfixes:
        - Do not die when encountering a deprecated asset format.
        - Update return value documentation for info modules.
        - Add Sensu Go 5.17.x and 5.18.x to the test suite and remove the
          unsupported versions (5.14.2 and lower).
        - Update the role metadata with proper platform markers.
        - Remove unsupported Ubuntu versions from the test suite.

      release_summary: |
        Authenticating with style on Debian
        
        Sensu Go 5.15.0 gained an API key authentication method and the
        Ansible collection finally caught up. This means that we can now
        replace *user* and *password* authentication parameters with a single
        *api_key* value.
       
        And the other big news is the addition of Debian support to the
        `install` role.
      minor_changes:
        - Add API key authentication support.
        - Add support for Debian installation.

        Building support for builds

        This release adds support for specifying builds when installing
        various Sensu Go components.
      minor_changes:
        - Add *build* variable to the *install* role that further pins down
          the package version that gets installed.

  1.1.1:
    release_date: "2020-01-08"

      release_summary: |
        Python 2 is Still a Thing

        This is a bugfix release that makes sure the Sensu collection is
        working when Ansible control node uses Python 2.
      minor_changes:
        - Add support for RHEL 7 to the install role (thanks, @danragnar).
      bugfixes:
        - Accept *str* and *unicode* instance as a valid string in
          *bonsai_asset* action plugin.

        Hello Sensu Go 5.16

        This is the first release that supports installing Sensu Go 5.16.
      minor_changes:
        - Support for Sensu Go 5.16 initialization in backend role.
        - Support for external datastore management using *datastore* and
          *datastore_info* modules.
      bugfixes:

        Rising From The Ashes

        This is the initial stable release of the Sensu Go Ansible Collection.
        It contains roles for installing and configuring Sensu Go backends and
        agents and a set of modules for managing Sensu Go resources.

        Where does the release name comes from? We took an existing Ansible
        Collection that @flowerysong wrote, gave it a thorough tune-up and
        added a comprehensive test suite. And now, it is ready to face the
        world!
